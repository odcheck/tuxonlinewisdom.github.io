It took me about 8 hours to paint these 64 miniatures, which were in the box of Zombicide Episode 1. 
Things I needed for that were out of patience:
* A Primer from The Army Painter - Necrotic Flesh
* For the bases, Modeling scree and grass  and simple craft glue.
* Brushes brush and one two thin and fine brushes
* Acrylic-based inks designed specifically for painting such miniatures, also from The Army Painter, as well as ordinary acrylic paints.
* A Deep Shader

Most of my Army Painter colors are from the Zombicide Warpaints Package.
