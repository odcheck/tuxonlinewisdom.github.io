*"My network in WSL2 is so slow, I am so sad."*  
*"Hey I know something, why don't you check the resolv.conf".*  
*"Oh great jimkelo93, that helped me!"*

**Yeah, fuck off.**  
Is the network slow in throughput or is "the network" slow because DNS name resolution is fucking around?

Long story short, here are a few key points.  
I don't care what's going on with your hobble box, here's how it works for me.

* Windows 11 Pro
* Intel i5 cheap ass processor
* 16 GB Ram of cheapness 
* SSD from the trash
* more I could not care less stuff 

The question is, why is the **NETWORK** in WSL2 slow and why the heck is the vEthernet (WSL) adapter not shown in the control panel?
I fast forward to the solution, after all this is my personal online notebook and I just want to read the solution in case I need it again.

```ipconfig /all``` shows the god damm nic but not the control panel, so no gui for settings here.

### Solution
```
Disable-NetAdapterBinding -Name "vEthernet (WSL)" -ComponentID ms_tcpip6 -IncludeHidden # disable ipv6
Disable-NetAdapterLso -Name "vEthernet (WSL)" -IncludeHidden # Seems to disable the large packet. Didn't tested it since mine was already disabled

Get-NetAdapterBinding -IncludeHidden -Name "vEthernet (WSL)" # Check if ipv6 was disabled
Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -IncludeHidden -Name "vEthernet (WSL)" # Check if large packet was disabled
```
