It is likely that you're using a pager such as less or most since the output of ps aux is longer than a screenful. If so, the following options will cause (or force) long lines to wrap instead of being truncated.
```
ps aux | less -+S
```
```
ps aux | most -w
```
If you use either of the following commands, lines won't be wrapped but you can use your arrow keys or other movement keys to scroll left and right.
```
ps aux | less -S    # use arrow keys, or Esc-( and Esc-), or Alt-( and Alt-) 
```
```
ps aux | most       # use arrow keys, or < and > (Tab can also be used to scroll right)
```
Lines are always wrapped for more and pg. \
When ps aux is used in a pipe, the w option is unnecessary since ps only uses screen width when output is to the terminal.
