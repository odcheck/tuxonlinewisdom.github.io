**Solution** \
Open the parent folder that has the subfolders containing images. \
Click on the search box, and type the following search query: 
```
kind:=picture
```
Another Windows Specical... I did not check the build Version but in some cases you will have use this search query:
```
art:=picture
```
Select all or the image files you want from the search results, right-click and select Set as desktop background.

Thatâ€™s it!
