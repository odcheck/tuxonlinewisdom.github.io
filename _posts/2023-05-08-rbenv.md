First install the dependency crap. I am using Ubuntu 20.4 and 22.
```shell
sudo apt update
```
{: .nolineno }
```shell
sudo apt install git curl autoconf bison build-essential \
    libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm6 libgdbm-dev libdb-dev
```
{: .nolineno }
Next stop, grap that line and smack it into to your shell.
This will donwload stuff, does some other stuff.
```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```
{: .nolineno }
When this finishes, you'll have to paste this lines into your shell of love.
```shell
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
{: .nolineno }
Guess what, it's time to install a ruby version of your choice.
List all given versions like this.
```shell
rbenv install -l
```
{: .nolineno }
However, I've installed 3.2.2 for my jekyll stuff like this.
```shell
rbenv install 3.2.2
rbenv global 3.2.2
```
{: .nolineno }
That is all about it.
